                        <p>I was first exposed to programming at a young age. I must have been 11 or 12 years old. My father, a self-taught software engineer, had all these thick programming books at home. I picked up the book on Visual Basic .NET and started learning. I had fun being able to control Windows Forms with the power of code.</p>
                        <p>In my teenage years, I discovered MySpace. The best part about MySpace for me was having the ability to change the CSS to my page. (this page is a homage to MySpace). This is when I really got interested in programming.</p>
                        <p>Later, while still in my teenage years, I was concurrently enrolled in classes at the local community college. My first programming class was Python (it must have been version 2.4 or 2.5). I learned how to write a game. I exceeded the 'A' grade requirements quickly, and added cosmetics and other fun things to the game.</p>
                        <p>I've decided that I want to be a React developer.</p>

                            <p>This webpage generates a title using random words (of specific types). This generator takes a random adverb, adjective and noun to create a random title. I did this project because I had searched the web for a random title generator, but all I could find were name generators and sentence generators. I could never find what I was specifically looking for, so I made my own.</p>
